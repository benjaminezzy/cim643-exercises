    <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
    <h2>By: Robert Frost</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        And sorry I could not travel both
        And be one traveler, long I stood
        And looked down one as far as I could
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>
        Then took the other, as just as fair,
        And having perhaps the better claim
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
        Though as for that the passing there
        Had worn them really about the same,<br><br>
        And both that morning equally lay
        In leaves no step had trodden black.
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way
        I doubted if I should ever come back.<br><br>
        I shall be telling this with a sigh
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
        I took the one less traveled by,
        And that has made all the difference.</p>
